# DecathlonMAIN---1.1
 In grade 10 in my CompSci(11) class, we were assigned to make a game that was the theme of a decathlon with programming related questions. To go a step beyond (for yes, a good mark), I decided to learn PyGame and make it an actual game instead of being a text-based interaction. This was done in partners, and my partner handled the questions part of the game.

This game is meant to be played in 3s.

The project includes a leaderboard but that isn't fully developed because there was no need for it, but I wanted to learn filereading.
